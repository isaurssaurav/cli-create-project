# Fuse React Boilerplate

This is a initiative aimed to increase development velocity of frontend developers for React projects. This is the starting point for all new projects.

This project is made by continuous collaboration between JS team and design team of **Fusemachines**.

## Installation

- Run command `yarn`
- Change app titles in `package.json`, `public/manifest.json` and `public/index.html`
- Install `docker` and `docker-compose` from [here]https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Run command `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- Run command `docker-compose up` to run container

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
