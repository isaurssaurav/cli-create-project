## src/components/design

This folder is separated for the design team.

Follow these steps:-

- Create a route for a new screen component in the `Router.tsx` file
- Create a new file for the new route component like `Example.tsx`
- Convert html to react usable code (_eg. converting class to className_) and add it in the component
- `yarn start`
- Goto `/design/{route}` - replace route with the route you created
