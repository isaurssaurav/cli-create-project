## src/component/Main

This folder will illustrates a typical example of a component with it's own router.

This folder will follow the following structure:-

- `index.tsx`
- `Main.tsx`
- `Router.tsx`

## src/components/Main/index.tsx

The index file will in most cases export main component as it's default. But in case of possible child router, it will export that router as it's default.

## src/components/Main/Main.tsx

Main can be either stateless or stateful react component.

## src/components/Main/Router.tss

The router component will contain all child routes of main router.
